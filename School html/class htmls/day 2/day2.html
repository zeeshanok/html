        Use your knees, feet, elbows and knuckles instead If you're still pressing elevator buttons with your fingertips, stop. Any time you have to open a door, push a button, pull a lever or digitally sign for something, use a different body part instead. You
        have plenty. For example, I'll often tap out a pin code with my knuckle instead of the pad of my finger, or push open a door with my shoulder, hip or foot instead of my hands. You can usually flip on a light switch or sink faucet with your elbow
        or wrist, and you can wrap the sleeve of your sweater or jacket around the handle of doors you have to physically pull open. It's easy enough to toss your clothing into the wash later rather than expose your skin now, especially if the chances
        you'll use your hands to touch food items is high (e.g. you're opening the door to a coffee shop).
